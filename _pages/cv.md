description: >
  Aven Arlington is a software engineer with a ten-year career focus on embedded development and automated test systems. With a strong belief that source code is analogous to truth, it follows that he considers tests to be the arbiter of honesty by which ambiguities, omissions, and incorrect behavior can be identified. Through his software development work in the test and measurement space, he has indirectly helped countless products reach their market quickly, economically, and with fewer defects. Aven participates in the occasional regatta and spends time outdoors with his dog Tex. Indoors he enjoys video games and is passionate about game design.
